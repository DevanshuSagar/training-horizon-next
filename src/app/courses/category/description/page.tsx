            As children, we absorb information and learn from experiences that
            mold us into who we are. Many individuals impact a child's life, but
            the most powerful and influential role lies in a devoted teacher; a
            teacher provides growth to students as a gardener would to a garden
            of flowers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Each child can bloom into a thriving flower so long as you water
            their garden with optimism, love, patience, and guidance. Throughout
            my educational experiences, I was lucky enough to have educators who
            poured their knowledge and optimism into me, and now I would like to
            reciprocate that back to students who are in the position I was once
            in.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Balancing life and school is hard enough for a student, but a
            powerful and caring teacher can steer you in the right direction. In
            this autobiography, you will read about my educational background,
            experiences that influenced my decision to become a teacher, and
            what I believe the role of a teacher should be in a student's life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            As a student, I went to multiple schools, I went to three different
            elementary schools, two middle schools, and two high schools in
            Brownsville, and through it all, I had great experiences.
            Brownsville is a humble community with low socioeconomic status, but
            rich in culture, history, and unity. In retrospect, the
            socioeconomic status was changing as I attended different schools,
            depending on the area of the school, of course.
